# 1stPublicRep-DataJourn
I honestly picked this question simply because it was the first interesting opinionated question I saw. Thinking about sitting in seats that no one has bought and are open seems like a no brainer to me.
It’s clear to me now that people have extremely different views on flying etiquette. I'm especially curious how this dataset might compare to similar situations on trains with assigned seating, like the Shinkansen in Japan, or how opinions might differ across race, ethnicity, or income levels.
The chart shows that a large majority of respondents — 690 out of 855 — said it’s **not rude at all** to move to an unsold seat on a plane. A smaller portion (128 people) thought it was *somewhat rude*, while only 37 believed it was *very rude*. The visual emphasizes how strongly the public leans toward viewing the action as acceptable, despite some disagreement.
